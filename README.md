Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is creating, building, testing, and maintaining software. It helps in making effective and reliable programs that people and businesses use on a daily basis. It is important because;
It ensures that software performs as it is expected to and is easy to use.
It helps companies to come up with better technology faster.
It helps companies to address real-world problems with software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-60s: Programming Is Born – Computers initially made use of simple programming languages like Assembly.
1970s-80s: Structured Programming – Modular programming, amongst other new techniques, made the software more comprehendible and simpler to fix.
1990s-Present: AI and Agile in Software Development – AI technologies and accelerated development methods (like Agile) improved software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Problem definition and goal setting.
Requirements Gathering – Collecting what the users need from the software.
Design – Drawing up a plan of how the software will work.
Implementation (Coding) – Making the actual program.
Testing – Checking for errors and fixing faults.
Deployment – Putting the software into operation for users.
Maintenance – Renovation and improving the software over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Processes are Linear, one phase at a time while Agile is adaptive, changes can be made at any point.
Waterfall is Best Suited For Projects with clear requirements while Agile is best suited for projects which can change often
A sample is waterfall works well in Developing a bank system where each phase must be finished in order while Agile is the way to go when building a mobile app where features are constantly updated and tested.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes and fixes the code.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests the software to find and fix issues.
Project Manager – Organizes the team, ensures deadlines are met


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help developers write and test code faster. Example: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) track changes in code and prevent mistakes. Example: Git, GitHub.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging Errors → Use debugging tools and ask teammates for help.
Maintaining Pace with the Latest Technology → Enroll for web lessons and rehearse newer skills.
Working in Teams → Use collaboration and communication utilities like Slack or Trello.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Checks small parts of the code.
Integration Testing – Tests if different parts work together.
System Testing – Checks the entire software.
Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the technique of querying AI with exact and brief questions in order to get better answers.

Why is it needed?

It helps AI deliver useful and accurate responses.
It makes the AI more useful for writing, programming, and research.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."
Improved Prompt: "Explain how AI is utilized in healthcare, with examples of advantages." 

Why is it improved?

It is more precise (healthcare focus).
It asks for examples (so the answer is more useful).
